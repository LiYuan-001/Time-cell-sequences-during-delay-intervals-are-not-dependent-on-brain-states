# Time-cell-sequences-during-delay-intervals-are-not-dependent-on-brain-states

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS 
- Software dependencies:
MATLAB (MathWorks) version r2020a
Open-source Matlab codes:
Neuralynx MATLAB Import/Export MEX Files V.6.0.0: https://neuralynx.fh-co.com/research-software/#matlab-netcom-utilities
Toolbox for cell assembly detection: https://github.com/tortlab/Cell-Assembly-Detection

- Operating System
OS: Windows 10 Pro 22H2
- The codes have also been tested on MATLAB version r2019b 
- The codes were developed using this hardware:
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-13900K 3.00GHz   
RAM: 64.0 GB 
No other specific or non-standard hardware is required.

INSTALLATION GUIDE
- All codes can be downloaded and used right away

- DEMO
- Instructions: The code for running the demo is named ‘Democode’ and 'DemoData'.

  INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
- Add both folder into work path and run the code 'CellDefinition.m'
- Expected output: Define delay active cell, time cell, time-limited cell and consistent on cell and plot figures (Main Figure 2-4).
- Expected time to run demo on desktop computer: 10 minutes
- All other codes are included in the folder ‘AllSessions’. Those codes are not sufficiently well structured yet. All codes needed for reproducing the results of the paper are included in the folder ‘AllSessions’.
