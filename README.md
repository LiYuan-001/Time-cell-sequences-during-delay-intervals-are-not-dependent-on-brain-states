# Time-cell-sequences-during-delay-intervals-are-not-dependent-on-brain-states

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS 
- Software dependencies:
MATLAB (MathWorks) version r2020a
Open-source Matlab codes:
Neuralynx MATLAB Import/Export MEX Files V.6.0.0: https://neuralynx.fh-co.com/research-software/#matlab-netcom-utilities

- Operating System
OS: Windows 10 Pro 22H2
- The codes have also been tested on MATLAB version r2019b 
- The codes were developed using this hardware:
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-13900K 3.00GHz   
RAM: 64.0 GB 
No other specific or non-standard hardware is required.

INSTALLATION GUIDE
- All codes can be downloaded and used right away

- DEMO
- Instructions: The code for running the demo is named ‘GenerateExample’ and can be found in ‘main’. The example session is provided in the data folder.
- Expected output: Figures with stacked autocorrelations, 2 example cells (Fig 1b,c), and rasterplots using different sorting methods (Fig 2a,b – Extended data Figure 4d).
- Expected time to run demo on desktop computer: 5 minutes

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
- How to run the software: The codes in the folder ‘Selected codes’ can be run in order, cell by cell. Typically the first cells load the data and perform all quantifications, and the last cells make the figures included in the paper. Each of these codes (except for the demo, see above) indicate, at the beginning, which of the paper figures they output. 
- All other codes are included in the folder ‘All codes’. Those codes are not sufficiently well structured yet. All codes needed for reproducing the results of the paper are included in the folder ‘All codes’.

FURTHER COMMENTS
- The code running for all sessions are in the folder 'All_codes'
